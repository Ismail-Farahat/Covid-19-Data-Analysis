# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
This project was for my probability class in my college.
# Info about Covid-19
The 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic of coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in
December 2019, and was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. As of 25 March, more than 446,000 cases
of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 190 countries and territories,
resulting in more than 19,800 deaths and more than 113,000 recoveries
# The analysis Process
In this project, I used probability theories, distribution curves and 
correlation coefficient for making a regression model to analysis covid-19 data
to understand how the virus spread developed.
# Data
### I gathered the data by my self from multiple trusted websites like:  
1- World Health Organization (WHO)  
2- Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention  
3- European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  
4- Data world website  
5- Kaggle website  
6- Worldometers
